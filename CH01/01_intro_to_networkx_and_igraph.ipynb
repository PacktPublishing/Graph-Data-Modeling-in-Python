    "Igraph is a collection of network analysis tools with the emphasis being on efficiency, portability and ease of use. What is great about igraph is that it is open source and free, plus it supports networks to be built in R, Python, Mathematica and C / C++. This is our recommended package for the creation of large networks that can load much more quickly than NetworkX. To read more about igraph: https://igraph.org/."
